# 🧠 Mood Timeline – Segment-Level Video Emotion Analyzer

---

## 🎯 Overview  

**Mood Timeline** is a prototype feature built as part of my **College Minor Project**, designed to analyze any video and detect its *emotional tone (Calm / Neutral / Hype)* across different segments.  

It visually represents these emotions as a **color-coded timeline** under the video player — helping users quickly jump to their preferred mood-based parts of a video.  

This project is part of a larger idea — an **AI-powered Video Summarization Extension** that can later work on platforms like **YouTube, Coursera, and Udemy**.  

> 🧩 A **sample video and transcript** are included in this repository only for demonstration purposes , You can locally add a video accordingly.

## ⚙️ Features  

- 🎬 **Video Segmentation** – Splits video into multiple segments using time and transcript boundaries.  
- 😄 **Mood Detection** – Detects emotion (Calm / Neutral / Hype) per segment using transcript, prosody (audio), and visuals.  
- 🎨 **Mood Timeline UI** – Displays color-coded mood changes below the video scrubber.  
  - 🟦 Calm  
  - 🟨 Neutral  
  - 🟥 Hype  
- 🎚️ **Mood Filter** – Filter or jump to parts of the video based on mood.  
- 🌐 **API Endpoint** – Provides mood predictions with confidence scores for each segment.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Input Collection**  
   User provides either a local video file or a YouTube URL.  
   - If YouTube URL → system uses **`youtube-transcript-api`** to fetch auto-generated subtitles.  

2. **Segmentation**  
   Transcript is divided into short sentences or scene-level segments (usually 20–30 seconds).  

3. **Feature Extraction**  
   Each segment is analyzed using three data types:  
   - **Text (Lexical):** Extracts sentiment polarity from transcript words.  
   - **Audio (Prosodic):** Measures pitch, energy, and volume variance using libraries like `librosa`.  
   - **Visual (Frames):** Captures brightness and color intensity from thumbnails every few seconds.  

4. **Mood Classification**  
   Based on the extracted features, the system classifies each segment into:  
   - 🟦 Calm → Low energy, neutral tone  
   - 🟨 Neutral → Balanced speech and words  
   - 🟥 Hype → High excitement and intensity  

5. **Visualization**  
   - The React frontend renders a **color-coded timeline** below the video scrubber.  
   - Hovering shows timestamp, mood label, and confidence score.  
   - A dropdown lets users filter and jump directly to specific moods.

## 🧠 API Endpoints

🎧 1. **Upload Video**
```bash
POST /upload
Body: multipart/form-data { file: video.mp4 }
Response: { videoId: "abc123" }
```
📝 2. **Fetch YouTube Transcript**
```bash
GET /transcript/:videoId
Response: { transcript: "text...", segments: [{ start, end, text }] }


Uses youtube-transcript-api Python library for automatic caption retrieval.
```
🔍 3. **Mood Prediction**
```bash
POST /mood/:videoId
Response:
{
  "segments": [
    { "t0": 0, "t1": 30, "mood": "calm", "confidence": 0.82 },
    { "t0": 30, "t1": 60, "mood": "hype", "confidence": 0.91 }
  ]
}
```
🧾 4. **Generate Summary**
```bash
POST /summary/:videoId
Response: { summary: "The video mainly has neutral tone with hype in the conclusion." }
```

## 🎓 About the Project

This feature was developed by me as part of a Minor Project during B.Tech in Computer Science.

The goal was to research and prototype AI-driven emotion analysis for videos, focusing on enhancing user engagement and content navigation through emotional understanding.
